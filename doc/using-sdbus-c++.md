Introduction
------------

sdbus-c++ is a C++ wrapper library built on top of [sd-bus](http://0pointer.net/blog/the-new-sd-bus-api-of-systemd.html), a lightweight D-Bus client library implemented within systemd project. It provides D-Bus functionality on a higher level of abstraction, trying to employ C++ type system to shift as much work as possible from the developer to the compiler.

sdbus-c++ does not cover the entire sd-bus API, but provides tools for implementing the most common functionality - RPC method calls, signals and properties. There is room for additions and improvements, as needed and when needed.

Integrating sdbus-c++ into your project
---------------------------------------

The library build system is based on CMake. The library provides a config file, so integrating it into your CMake project is rather straight-forward:

```bash
find_package(sdbus-c++ REQUIRED)
```

The library also supports `pkg-config`, so it easily be integrated into e.g. an Autotools project:

```bash
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(SDBUSCPP, [sdbus-c++ >= 0.4],,
    AC_MSG_ERROR([You need the sdbus-c++ library (version 0.4 or newer)]
    [http://www.kistler.com/])
)
```

Note: sdbus-c++ library depends on C++17, since it uses C++17 `std::uncaught_exceptions()` feature. When building sdbus-c++ manually, make sure you use a compiler that supports that feature. To use the library, make sure you have a C++ standard library that supports the feature. The feature is supported by e.g. gcc >= 6, and clang >= 3.7.

Header files and namespaces
---------------------------

All sdbus-c++ header files reside in the `sdbus-c++` subdirectory within the standard include directory. Users can either include individual header files, like so:

```cpp
#include <sdbus-c++/IConnection.h>
#include <sdbus-c++/IObjectProxy.h>
```

or just include the global header file that pulls in everything:

```cpp
#include <sdbus-c++/sdbus-c++.h>
```

All public types and functions of sdbus-c++ reside in the `sdbus` namespace.

Error signalling and propagation
--------------------------------

`sdbus::Error` exception is used to signal errors in sdbus-c++. There are two types of errors:

  * D-Bus related errors, like call timeouts, failed socket allocation, etc. These are raised by the D-Bus library or D-Bus daemon itself.
  * user-defined errors, i.e. errors signalled and propagated from remote methods back to the caller. So these are issued by sdbus-c++ users.

`sdbus::Error` is a carrier for both types of errors, carrying the error name and error message with it.

Design of sdbus-c++
-------------------

The following diagram illustrates the major entities in sdbus-c++.

![class](sdbus-c++-class-diagram.png)

`IConnection` represents the concept of a D-Bus connection. You can connect to either the system bus or a session bus. Services can assign unique service names to those connections. A processing loop should be run on the connection.

`IObject` represents the concept of an object that exposes its methods, signals and properties. Its responsibilities are:

  * registering (possibly multiple) interfaces and methods, signals, properties on those interfaces,
  * emitting signals.

`IObjectProxy` represents the concept of the proxy, which is a view of the `Object` from the client side. Its responsibilities are:

  * invoking remote methods of the corresponding object, in both synchronous and asynchronous way,
  * registering handlers for signals,

`Message` class represents a message, which is the fundamental DBus concept. There are three distinctive types of message that derive from the `Message` class:

  * `MethodCall` (with serialized parameters),
  * `MethodReply` (with serialized return values),
  * or a `Signal` (with serialized parameters).

### Thread safety in sdbus-c++

sdbus-c++ is thread-aware by design. But, in general, it's not thread-safe. At least not in all places. There are situations where sdbus-c++ provides and guarantees API-level thread safety by design. It is safe to do these operations from multiple threads at the same time:

  * Making and destroying `Object`s and `ObjectProxy`s, even on a shared connection that is already running an event loop. Under *making* here is meant a complete atomic sequence of construction, registration of method/signal/property callbacks and export of the `Object`/`ObjectProxy` so it is ready to issue/receive messages. This sequence must be done in one thread.
  * Creating and sending asynchronous method replies on an `Object` instance.
  * Creating and emitting signals on an `Object` instance.
  * Creating and sending method calls (both synchronously and asynchronously) on an `ObjectProxy` instance. (But it's generally better that our threads use their own exclusive instances of object proxy, to minimize shared state and contention.)

Multiple layers of sdbus-c++ API
-------------------------------

sdbus-c++ API comes in two layers:

  * [the basic layer](#implementing-the-concatenator-example-using-basic-sdbus-c-api-layer), which is a simple wrapper layer on top of sd-bus, using mechanisms that are native to C++ (e.g. serialization/deserialization of data from messages),
  * [the convenience layer](#implementing-the-concatenator-example-using-convenience-sdbus-c-api-layer), building on top of the basic layer, which aims at alleviating users from unnecessary details and enables them to write shorter, safer, and more expressive code.

sdbus-c++ also ships with a stub generator tool that converts D-Bus IDL in XML format into stub code for the adaptor as well as proxy part. Hierarchically, these stubs provide yet another layer of convenience (the "stubs layer"), making it possible for D-Bus RPC calls to completely look like native C++ calls on a local object.

An example: Number concatenator
-------------------------------

Let's have an object `/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator` that implements the `org.sdbuscpp.concatenator` interface. The interface exposes the following:

  * a `concatenate` method that takes a collection of integers and a separator string and returns a string that is the concatenation of all integers from the collection using given separator,
  * a `concatenated` signal that is emitted at the end of each successful concatenation.

In the following sections, we will elaborate on the ways of implementing such an object on both the server and the client side.

Implementing the Concatenator example using basic sdbus-c++ API layer
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In the basic API layer, we already have abstractions for D-Bus connections, objects and object proxies, with which we can interact via their interface classes (`IConnection`, `IObject`, `IObjectProxy`), but, analogously to the underlying sd-bus C library, we still work on the level of D-Bus messages. We need to

  * create them,
  * serialize/deserialize arguments to/from them (thanks to many overloads of C++ insertion/extraction operators, this is very simple),
  * send them over to the other side.

This is how a simple Concatenator service implemented upon the basic sdbus-c++ API could look like:

### Server side

```c++
#include <sdbus-c++/sdbus-c++.h>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Yeah, global variable is ugly, but this is just an example and we want to access 
// the concatenator instance from within the concatenate method handler to be able
// to emit signals.
sdbus::IObject* g_concatenator{};

void concatenate(sdbus::MethodCall& call, sdbus::MethodReply& reply)
{
    // Deserialize the collection of numbers from the message
    std::vector<int> numbers;
    call >> numbers;
    
    // Deserialize separator from the message
    std::string separator;
    call >> separator;
    
    // Return error if there are no numbers in the collection
    if (numbers.empty())
        throw sdbus::Error("org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator.Error", "No numbers provided");
    
    std::string result;
    for (auto number : numbers)
    {
        result += (result.empty() ? std::string() : separator) + std::to_string(number);
    }
    
    // Serialize resulting string to the reply
    reply << result;
    
    // Emit 'concatenated' signal
    const char* interfaceName = "org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator";
    auto signal = g_concatenator->createSignal(interfaceName, "concatenated");
    signal << result;
    g_concatenator->emitSignal(signal);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create D-Bus connection to the system bus and requests name on it.
    const char* serviceName = "org.sdbuscpp.concatenator";
    auto connection = sdbus::createSystemBusConnection(serviceName);

    // Create concatenator D-Bus object.
    const char* objectPath = "/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator";
    auto concatenator = sdbus::createObject(*connection, objectPath);
    
    g_concatenator = concatenator.get();
    
    // Register D-Bus methods and signals on the concatenator object, and exports the object.
    const char* interfaceName = "org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator";
    concatenator->registerMethod(interfaceName, "concatenate", "ais", "s", &concatenate);
    concatenator->registerSignal(interfaceName, "concatenated", "s");
    concatenator->finishRegistration();

    // Run the loop on the connection.
    connection->enterProcessingLoop();
}
```

We establish a D-Bus sytem connection and request `org.sdbuscpp.concatenator` D-Bus name on it. This name will be used by D-Bus clients to find the service. We then create an object with path `/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator` on this connection. We register  interfaces, its methods, signals that the object provides, and, through `finishRegistration()`, export the object (i.e., make it visible to clients) on the bus. Then we need to make sure to run the event loop upon the connection, which handles all incoming, outgoing and other requests.

The callback for any D-Bus object method on this level is any callable of signature `void(sdbus::MethodCall& call, sdbus::MethodReply& reply)`. The first parameter `call` is the incoming method call message. We need to deserialize input arguments from it. When we can invoke the logic and get the results. Then we serialize the results to the second parameter, the pre-constructed `reply` message. The reply is then sent automatically by sdbus-c++. We also fire a signal with the results. To do this, we need to create a signal message via object's `createSignal()`, serialize the results into it, and then send it out to subscribers by invoking object's `emitSignal()`.

Please note that we can create and destroy D-Bus objects on a connection dynamically, at any time during runtime, even while there is an active event loop upon the connection. So managing D-Bus objects' lifecycle (creating, exporting and destroying D-Bus objects) is completely thread-safe.

### Client side

```c++
#include <sdbus-c++/sdbus-c++.h>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

void onConcatenated(sdbus::Signal& signal)
{
    std::string concatenatedString;
    signal >> concatenatedString;
    
    std::cout << "Received signal with concatenated string " << concatenatedString << std::endl;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create proxy object for the concatenator object on the server side. Since here
    // we are creating the proxy instance without passing connection to it, the proxy
    // will create its own connection automatically, and it will be system bus connection.
    const char* destinationName = "org.sdbuscpp.concatenator";
    const char* objectPath = "/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator";
    auto concatenatorProxy = sdbus::createObjectProxy(destinationName, objectPath);
    
    // Let's subscribe for the 'concatenated' signals
    const char* interfaceName = "org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator";
    concatenatorProxy->registerSignalHandler(interfaceName, "concatenated", &onConcatenated);
    concatenatorProxy->finishRegistration();
    
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    std::string separator = ":";
    
    // Invoke concatenate on given interface of the object
    {
        auto method = concatenatorProxy->createMethodCall(interfaceName, "concatenate");
        method << numbers << separator;
        auto reply = concatenatorProxy->callMethod(method);
        std::string result;
        reply >> result;
        assert(result == "1:2:3");
    }
    
    // Invoke concatenate again, this time with no numbers and we shall get an error
    {
        auto method = concatenatorProxy->createMethodCall(interfaceName, "concatenate");
        method << std::vector<int>() << separator;
        try
        {
            auto reply = concatenatorProxy->callMethod(method);
            assert(false);
        }
        catch(const sdbus::Error& e)
        {
            std::cerr << "Got concatenate error " << e.getName() << " with message " << e.getMessage() << std::endl;
        }
    }
    
    // Give sufficient time to receive 'concatenated' signal from the first concatenate invocation
    sleep(1);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In simple cases, we don't need to create D-Bus connection explicitly for our proxies. Unless a connection is provided to an object proxy explicitly via factory parameter, the proxy will create a connection of his own, and it will be a system bus connection. This is the case in the example above. (This approach is not scalable and resource-saving if we have plenty of proxies; see section [Working with D-Bus connections](#working-with-d-bus-connections-in-sdbus-c) for elaboration.) So, in the example, we create a proxy for object `/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator` publicly available at bus `org.sdbuscpp.concatenator`. We register signal handlers, if any, and finish the registration, making the object proxy ready for use.

The callback for a D-Bus signal handler on this level is any callable of signature `void(sdbus::Signal& signal)`. The one and only parameter `signal` is the incoming signal message. We need to deserialize arguments from it, and then we can do our business logic with it.

Subsequently, we invoke two RPC calls to object's `concatenate()` method. We create a method call message by invoking proxy's `createMethodCall()`. We serialize method input arguments into it, and make a synchronous call via proxy's `callMethod()`. As a return value we get the reply message as soon as it arrives. We deserialize return values from that message, and further use it in our program. The second `concatenate()` RPC call is done with invalid arguments, so we get a D-Bus error reply from the service, which as we can see is manifested via `sdbus::Error` exception being thrown.

Please note that we can create and destroy D-Bus object proxies dynamically, at any time during runtime, even when they share a common D-Bus connection and there is an active event loop upon the connection. So managing D-Bus object proxies' lifecycle (creating and destroying D-Bus object proxies) is completely thread-safe.

### Working with D-Bus connections in sdbus-c++

The design of D-Bus connections in sdbus-c++ allows for certain flexibility and enables users to choose simplicity over scalability or scalability (at a finer granularity of user's choice) at the cost of slightly decreased simplicity.

How shall we use connections in relation to D-Bus objects and object proxies?

A D-Bus connection is represented by a `Connection` instance. Each connection needs an event loop being run upon it. So it needs a thread handling the event loop. This thread serves all incoming and outgoing messages and all communication towards D-Bus daemon.

One process can have multiple D-Bus connections, with assigned unique bus names or without, as long as those with assigned bus names do not share a common bus name.

A D-Bus connection can be created for and used exclusively by one D-Bus object (represented by one `Object` instance) or D-Bus object proxy (represented by one `ObjectProxy` instance), but can very well be used by and shared across multiple objects, multiple proxies or even both multiple objects and proxies at the same time. When shared, one must bear in mind that the access to the connection is mutually exclusive and is serialized. This means, for example, that if an object's callback is going to be invoked for an incoming remote method call and in another thread we use a proxy to call remote method in another process, the threads are contending and only one can go on while the other must wait and can only proceed after the first one has finished, because both are using a shared resource -- the connection.

The former case (1:1) is one extreme; it's usually simple, has zero resource contention, but hurts scalability (for example, 50 proxies in our program need 50 D-Bus connections and 50 event loop threads upon them). The latter case (1:N) is the other extreme -- all D-Bus objects and proxies share one single connection. This is the most scalable solution (since, for example, 5 or 200 objects/proxies use always one single connection), but may increase contention and hurt concurrency (since only one of all those objects/proxies can work with the connection at a time). And then there are limitless options between the two (for example, we can use one connection for all objects, and another connection for all proxies in our service...). sdbus-c++ gives its users freedom to choose whatever approach is more suitable to them in their application at fine granularity.

How can we use connections from the server and the client perspective?

* On the *server* side, we generally need to create D-Bus objects and publish their APIs. For that we first need a connection with a unique bus name. We need to create the D-Bus connection manually ourselves, request bus name on it, and manually launch its event loop (in a blocking way, through `enterProcessingLoop()`, or non-blocking async way, through `enterProcessingLoopAsync()`). At any time before or after running the event loop on the connection, we can create and "hook", as well as remove, objects and proxies upon that connection.

* On the *client* side, for our D-Bus object proxies, we have more options (corresponding to three overloads of the `createObjectProxy()` factory):

    * We don't bother about any connection when creating a proxy. For each proxy instance sdbus-c++ also creates an internal connection instance to be used just by this proxy, and it will be a *system bus* connection. Additionally, an event loop thread for that connection is created and run internally.

      This hurts scalability (see discussion above), but our code is simpler, and since each proxy has its own connection, there is zero contention.

    * We create a connection explicitly by ourselves and `std::move` it to the object proxy factory. The proxy becomes an owner of this connection, and will run the event loop on that connection. This is the same as in the above bullet point, but with a flexibility that we can choose the bus type (system, session bus).

    * We are always full owners of the connection. We create the connection, and a proxy only takes and keeps a reference to it. We take care of the event loop upon that connection (and we must ensure the connection exists as long as all its users exist).

Implementing the Concatenator example using convenience sdbus-c++ API layer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the major sdbus-c++ design goals is to make the sdbus-c++ API easy to use correctly, and hard to use incorrectly.

The convenience API layer abstracts the concept of underlying D-Bus messages away completely. It abstracts away D-Bus signatures. The interface uses small, focused functions, with a few parameters only, to form a chained function statement that reads like a human language sentence. To achieve that, sdbus-c++ utilizes the power of the C++ type system, which deduces and resolves a lot of things at compile time, and the run-time performance cost compared to the basic layer is close to zero.

Thus, in the end of the day, the code written using the convenience API is:

  - more expressive,
  - closer to the abstraction level of the problem being solved,
  - shorter,
  - almost as fast as one written using the basic API layer.

The code written using this layer expresses *what* it does, rather then *how*. Let's look at code samples.

### Server side

```c++
#include <sdbus-c++/sdbus-c++.h>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Yeah, global variable is ugly, but this is just an example and we want to access 
// the concatenator instance from within the concatenate method handler to be able
// to emit signals.
sdbus::IObject* g_concatenator{};

std::string concatenate(const std::vector<int> numbers, const std::string& separator)
{
    // Return error if there are no numbers in the collection
    if (numbers.empty())
        throw sdbus::Error("org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator.Error", "No numbers provided");
    
    std::string result;
    for (auto number : numbers)
    {
        result += (result.empty() ? std::string() : separator) + std::to_string(number);
    }
    
    // Emit 'concatenated' signal
    const char* interfaceName = "org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator";
    g_concatenator->emitSignal("concatenated").onInterface(interfaceName).withArguments(result);
    
    return result;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create D-Bus connection to the system bus and requests name on it.
    const char* serviceName = "org.sdbuscpp.concatenator";
    auto connection = sdbus::createSystemBusConnection(serviceName);

    // Create concatenator D-Bus object.
    const char* objectPath = "/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator";
    auto concatenator = sdbus::createObject(*connection, objectPath);
    
    g_concatenator = concatenator.get();
    
    // Register D-Bus methods and signals on the concatenator object, and exports the object.
    const char* interfaceName = "org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator";
    concatenator->registerMethod("concatenate").onInterface(interfaceName).implementedAs(&concatenate);
    concatenator->registerSignal("concatenated").onInterface(interfaceName).withParameters<std::string>();
    concatenator->finishRegistration();

    // Run the loop on the connection.
    connection->enterProcessingLoop();
}
```

### Client side

```c++
#include <sdbus-c++/sdbus-c++.h>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

void onConcatenated(const std::string& concatenatedString)
{
    std::cout << "Received signal with concatenated string " << concatenatedString << std::endl;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create proxy object for the concatenator object on the server side
    const char* destinationName = "org.sdbuscpp.concatenator";
    const char* objectPath = "/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator";
    auto concatenatorProxy = sdbus::createObjectProxy(destinationName, objectPath);
    
    // Let's subscribe for the 'concatenated' signals
    const char* interfaceName = "org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator";
    concatenatorProxy->uponSignal("concatenated").onInterface(interfaceName).call([](const std::string& str){ onConcatenated(str); });
    concatenatorProxy->finishRegistration();
    
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    std::string separator = ":";
    
    // Invoke concatenate on given interface of the object
    {
        std::string concatenatedString;
        concatenatorProxy->callMethod("concatenate").onInterface(interfaceName).withArguments(numbers, separator).storeResultsTo(concatenatedString);
        assert(concatenatedString == "1:2:3");
    }
    
    // Invoke concatenate again, this time with no numbers and we shall get an error
    {
        try
        {
            concatenatorProxy->callMethod("concatenate").onInterface(interfaceName).withArguments(std::vector<int>(), separator);
            assert(false);
        }
        catch(const sdbus::Error& e)
        {
            std::cerr << "Got concatenate error " << e.getName() << " with message " << e.getMessage() << std::endl;
        }
    }
    
    // Give sufficient time to receive 'concatenated' signal from the first concatenate invocation
    sleep(1);
    
    return 0;
}
```

When registering methods, calling methods or emitting signals, multiple lines of code have shrunk into simple one-liners. Signatures of provided callbacks are introspected and types of provided arguments are deduced at compile time, so the D-Bus signatures as well as serialization and deserialization of arguments to and from D-Bus messages are generated for us completely by the compiler.

sdbus-c++ users shall prefer the convenience API to the lower level, basic API. When feasible, using generated adaptor and proxy stubs is even better. These stubs provide yet another, higher API level built on top of the convenience API. They are described in the following section.

Implementing the Concatenator example using sdbus-c++-generated stubs
---------------------------------------------------------------------

sdbus-c++ ships with the native stub generator tool called sdbuscpp-xml2cpp. The tool is very similar to dbusxx-xml2cpp tool that comes from dbus-c++ project.

The generator tool takes D-Bus XML IDL description of D-Bus interfaces on its input, and can be instructed to generate one or both of these: an adaptor header file for use at server side, and a proxy header file for use at client side. Like this:

```bash
sdbuscpp-xml2cpp database-bindings.xml --adaptor=database-server-glue.h --proxy=database-client-glue.h
```

The adaptor header file contains classes that can be used to implement described interfaces. The proxy header file contains classes that can be used to make calls to remote objects.

### XML description of the Concatenator interface

As an example, let's look at an XML description of our Concatenator's interfaces.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<node name="/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator">
    <interface name="org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator">
        <method name="concatenate">
            <arg type="ai" name="numbers" direction="in" />
            <arg type="s" name="separator" direction="in" />
            <arg type="s" name="concatenatedString" direction="out" />
        </method>
        <signal name="concatenated">
            <arg type="s" name="concatenatedString" />
        </signal>
    </interface>
</node>
```

After running this through the stubs generator, we get the stub code that is described in the following two subsections.

### concatenator-server-glue.h

There is specific class for each interface in the XML IDL file. The class is de facto an interface which shall be implemented by inheriting from it. The class' constructor takes care of registering all methods, signals and properties. For each D-Bus method there is a pure virtual member function. These pure virtual functions must be implemented in the child class. For each signal, there is a public function member that emits this signal.

        object_.emitSignal("concatenated").onInterface(interfaceName).withArguments(concatenatedString);
    }

private:
    virtual std::string concatenate(const std::vector<int32_t>& numbers, const std::string& separator) = 0;

private:
    sdbus::IObject& object_;
};

}} // namespaces

```

### concatenator-client-glue.h

Analogously to the adaptor classes described above, there is specific class for each interface in the XML IDL file. The class is de facto a proxy to the concrete interface of a remote object. For each D-Bus signal there is a pure virtual member function whose body must be provided in a child class. For each method, there is a public function member that calls the method remotely.

### Providing server implementation based on generated adaptors

To implement a D-Bus object that implements all its D-Bus interfaces, we shall create a class representing the object that inherits from all corresponding `*_adaptor` classes and implements all pure virtual member functions. Specifically, the object class shall inherit from the `Interfaces` template class, the template arguments of which are individual adaptor classes. The `Interfaces` is just a convenience class that hides a few boiler-plate details. For example, in its constructor, it creates an `Object` instance, it takes care of proper initialization of all adaptor superclasses, and exports the object finally.

```cpp
#include <sdbus-c++/sdbus-c++.h>
#include "concatenator-server-glue.h"

class Concatenator : public sdbus::Interfaces<org::sdbuscpp::Concatenator_adaptor /*, more adaptor classes if there are more interfaces*/>
{
public:
    Concatenator(sdbus::IConnection& connection, std::string objectPath)
        : sdbus::Interfaces<org::sdbuscpp::Concatenator_adaptor>(connection, std::move(objectPath))
    {
    }

protected:
    std::string concatenate(const std::vector<int32_t>& numbers, const std::string& separator) override
    {
        // Return error if there are no numbers in the collection
        if (numbers.empty())
            throw sdbus::Error("org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator.Error", "No numbers provided");
        
        // Concatenate the numbers
        std::string result;
        for (auto number : numbers)
        {
            result += (result.empty() ? std::string() : separator) + std::to_string(number);
        }
        
        // Emit the 'concatenated' signal with the resulting string
        concatenated(result);
        
        // Return the resulting string
        return result;
    }
};
```

That's it. We now have an implementation of a D-Bus object implementing `org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator` interface. Let's now create a service publishing the object.

```cpp
#include "Concatenator.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create D-Bus connection to the system bus and requests name on it.
    const char* serviceName = "org.sdbuscpp.concatenator";
    auto connection = sdbus::createSystemBusConnection(serviceName);

    // Create concatenator D-Bus object.
    const char* objectPath = "/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator";
    Concatenator concatenator(*connection, objectPath);

    // Run the loop on the connection.
    connection->enterProcessingLoop();
}
```

It's that simple :)

### Providing client implementation based on generated proxies

To implement a proxy for a remote D-Bus object, we shall create a class representing the object proxy that inherits from all corresponding `*_proxy` classes and -- if applicable -- implements all pure virtual member functions. Specifically, the object proxy class shall inherit from the `ProxyInterfaces` template class. As its template arguments we shall provide all proxy classes. The `ProxyInterfaces` is just a convenience class that hides a few boiler-plate details. For example, in its constructor, it creates an `ObjectProxy` instance, and it takes care of proper initialization of all proxy superclasses.

```cpp
#include <sdbus-c++/sdbus-c++.h>
#include "concatenator-client-glue.h"

class ConcatenatorProxy : public sdbus::ProxyInterfaces<org::sdbuscpp::Concatenator_proxy /*, more proxy classes if there are more interfaces*/>
{
public:
    ConcatenatorProxy(std::string destination, std::string objectPath)
        : sdbus::ProxyInterfaces<org::sdbuscpp::Concatenator_proxy>(std::move(destination), std::move(objectPath))
    {
    }

protected:
    void onConcatenated(const std::string& concatenatedString) override
    {
        std::cout << "Received signal with concatenated string " << concatenatedString << std::endl;
    }
};
```

In the above example, a proxy is created that creates and maintains its own system bus connection. However, there are `ProxyInterfaces` class template constructor overloads that also take the connection from the user as the first parameter, and pass that connection over to the underlying proxy. The connection instance is used for all D-Bus proxy interfaces listed in the `ProxyInterfaces` template parameter list.

Note however that there are multiple `ProxyInterfaces` constructor overloads, and they differ in how the proxy behaves towards the D-Bus connection. These overloads precisely map the `sdbus::createObjectProxy` overloads, as they are actually implemented on top of them. See [Proxy and D-Bus connection](#Proxy-and-D-Bus-connection) for more info.

Now let's use this proxy to make remote calls and listen to signals in a real application.

```cpp
#include "ConcatenatorProxy.h"
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create proxy object for the concatenator object on the server side
    const char* destinationName = "org.sdbuscpp.concatenator";
    const char* objectPath = "/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator";
    ConcatenatorProxy concatenatorProxy(destinationName, objectPath);

    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    std::string separator = ":";
    
    // Invoke concatenate with some numbers
    auto concatenatedString = concatenatorProxy.concatenate(numbers, separator);
    assert(concatenatedString == "1:2:3");
    
    // Invoke concatenate again, this time with no numbers and we shall get an error
    try
    {
        auto concatenatedString = concatenatorProxy.concatenate(std::vector<int>(), separator);
        assert(false);
    }
    catch(const sdbus::Error& e)
    {
        std::cerr << "Got concatenate error " << e.getName() << " with message " << e.getMessage() << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Give sufficient time to receive 'concatenated' signal from the first concatenate invocation
    sleep(1);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Asynchronous server-side methods
--------------------------------

So far in our tutorial, we have only considered simple server methods that are executed in a synchronous way. Sometimes the method call may take longer, however, and we don't want to block (potentially starve) other clients (whose requests may take relative short time). The solution is to execute the D-Bus methods asynchronously, and return the control quickly back to the D-Bus dispatching thread. sdbus-c++ provides API supporting async methods, and gives users the freedom to come up with their own concrete implementation mechanics (one worker thread? thread pool? ...).

### Lower-level API

Considering the Concatenator example based on lower-level API, if we wanted to write `concatenate` method in an asynchronous way, you only have to adapt method signature and its body (registering the method and all the other stuff stays the same):

```c++
void concatenate(sdbus::MethodCall& call, sdbus::MethodResult result)
{
    // Deserialize the collection of numbers from the message
    std::vector<int> numbers;
    call >> numbers;
    
    // Deserialize separator from the message
    std::string separator;
    call >> separator;
    
    // Launch a thread for async execution...
    std::thread([numbers, separator, result = std::move(result)]()
    {
        // Return error if there are no numbers in the collection
        if (numbers.empty())
        {
            // This will send the error reply message back to the client
            result.returnError("org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator.Error", "No numbers provided");
            return;
        }
        
        std::string concatenatedStr;
        for (auto number : numbers)
        {
            concatenatedStr += (result.empty() ? std::string() : separator) + std::to_string(number);
        }
        
        // This will send the reply message back to the client
        result.returnResults(concatenatedStr);
        
        // Note: emitting signals from other than D-Bus dispatcher thread is not supported yet...
        /*
        // Emit 'concatenated' signal
        const char* interfaceName = "org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator";
        auto signal = g_concatenator->createSignal(interfaceName, "concatenated");
        signal << result;
        g_concatenator->emitSignal(signal);
        */
    }).detach();
}
```

Notice these differences as compared to the synchronous version:

  * Instead of `MethodReply` message given by reference, there is `MethodResult` as a second parameter of the callback, which will hold method results and can be written to from any thread.

  * You shall pass the result holder (`MethodResult` instance) by moving it to the thread of execution, and eventually write method results (or method error) to it via its `returnResults()` or `returnError()` method, respectively.

  * Unlike in sync methods, reporting errors cannot be done by throwing sdbus::Error, since the execution takes place out of context of the D-Bus dispatcher thread. Instead, just pass the error name and message to the `returnError` method of the result holder.

That's all.

### Convenience API

Method callbacks in convenience sdbus-c++ API also need to take the result object as a parameter. The requirements are:

  * The result holder is of type `sdbus::Result<Types...>`, where `Types...` is a list of method output argument types.
  * The result object must be a first physical parameter of the callback taken by value.
  * The callback itself is physically a void-returning function.

For example, we would have to change the concatenate callback signature from `std::string concatenate(const std::vector<int32_t>& numbers, const std::string& separator)` to `void concatenate(sdbus::Result<std::string> result, const std::vector<int32_t>& numbers, const std::string& separator)`.

`sdbus::Result` class template has effectively the same API as `sdbus::MethodResult` class mentioned in the above example (it inherits from `MethodResult`), so you use it in the very same way to send the results or an error back to the client.

Nothing else has to be changed. The registration of the method callback (`implementedAs`) and all the mechanics around remains completely the same.

Note: Async D-Bus method doesn't necessarily mean we always have to delegate the work to a different thread and immediately return. We can very well execute the work and return the results (via `returnResults()`) or an error (via `return Error()`) synchronously -- i.e. directly in this thread. dbus-c++ doesn't care, it supports both approaches. This has the benefit that we can decide at run-time, per each method call, whether we execute it synchronously or (in case of complex operation, for example) execute it asynchronously by moving the work to a worker thread.

### Marking server-side async methods in the IDL

sdbus-c++ stub generator can generate stub code for server-side async methods. We just need to annotate the method with the `annotate` element having the "org.freedesktop.DBus.Method.Async" name. The element value must be either "server" (async method on server-side only) or "clientserver" (async method on both client- and server-side):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<node name="/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator">
    <interface name="org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator">
        <method name="concatenate">
            <annotation name="org.freedesktop.DBus.Method.Async" value="server" />
            <arg type="ai" name="numbers" direction="in" />
            <arg type="s" name="separator" direction="in" />
            <arg type="s" name="concatenatedString" direction="out" />
        </method>
        <signal name="concatenated">
            <arg type="s" name="concatenatedString" />
        </signal>
    </interface>
</node>
```

Asynchronous client-side methods
--------------------------------

sdbus-c++ also supports asynchronous approach at the client (the proxy) side. With this approach, we can issue a D-Bus method call without blocking current thread's execution while waiting for the reply. We go on doing other things, and when the reply comes, a given callback is invoked within the context of the D-Bus dispatcher thread.

### Lower-level API

Considering the Concatenator example based on lower-level API, if we wanted to call `concatenate` in an async way, we'd have to pass a callback to the proxy when issuing the call, and that callback gets invoked when the reply arrives:

```c++
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* ...  */
    
    auto callback = [](MethodReply& reply, const sdbus::Error* error)
    {
        if (error == nullptr) // No error
        {
            std::string result;
            reply >> result;
            std::cout << "Got concatenate result: " << result << std::endl;
        }
        else // We got a D-Bus error...
        {
            std::cerr << "Got concatenate error " << error->getName() << " with message " << error->getMessage() << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // Invoke concatenate on given interface of the object
    {
        auto method = concatenatorProxy->createMethodCall(interfaceName, "concatenate");
        method << numbers << separator;
        concatenatorProxy->callMethod(method, callback);
        // When the reply comes, we shall get "Got concatenate result 1:2:3" on the standard output
    }
    
    // Invoke concatenate again, this time with no numbers and we shall get an error
    {
        auto method = concatenatorProxy->createMethodCall(interfaceName, "concatenate");
        method << std::vector<int>() << separator;
        concatenatorProxy->callMethod(method, callback);
        // When the reply comes, we shall get concatenation error message on the standard error output
    }

    /* ... */

    return 0;
}
```

The callback is a void-returning function taking two arguments: a reference to the reply message, and a pointer to the prospective `sdbus::Error` instance. Zero `Error` pointer means that no D-Bus error occurred while making the call, and the reply message contains valid reply. Non-zero `Error` pointer, however, points to the valid `Error` instance, meaning that an error occurred. Error name and message can then be read out by the client from that instance.

### Convenience API

On the convenience API level, the call statement starts with `callMethodAsync()`, and ends with `uponReplyInvoke()` that takes a callback handler. The callback is a void-returning function that takes at least one argument: pointer to the `sdbus::Error` instance. All subsequent arguments shall exactly reflect the D-Bus method output arguments. A concatenator example:

```c++
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* ...  */
    
    auto callback = [](const sdbus::Error* error, const std::string& concatenatedString)
    {
        if (error == nullptr) // No error
            std::cout << "Got concatenate result: " << concatenatedString << std::endl;
        else // We got a D-Bus error...
            std::cerr << "Got concatenate error " << error->getName() << " with message " << error->getMessage() << std::endl;
    }

    // Invoke concatenate on given interface of the object
    {
        concatenatorProxy->callMethodAsync("concatenate").onInterface(interfaceName).withArguments(numbers, separator).uponReplyInvoke(callback);
        // When the reply comes, we shall get "Got concatenate result 1:2:3" on the standard output
    }

    // Invoke concatenate again, this time with no numbers and we shall get an error
    {
        concatenatorProxy->callMethodAsync("concatenate").onInterface(interfaceName).withArguments(std::vector<int>{}, separator).uponReplyInvoke(callback);
        // When the reply comes, we shall get concatenation error message on the standard error output
    }

    /* ... */

    return 0;
}
```

When the `Error` pointer is zero, it means that no D-Bus error occurred while making the call, and subsequent arguments are valid D-Bus method return values. Non-zero `Error` pointer, however, points to the valid `Error` instance, meaning that an error occurred during the call (and subsequent arguments are simply default-constructed). Error name and message can then be read out by the client from `Error` instance. 

### Marking client-side async methods in the IDL

sdbus-c++ stub generator can generate stub code for client-side async methods. We just need to annotate the method with the `annotate` element having the "org.freedesktop.DBus.Method.Async" name. The element value must be either "client" (async on the client-side only) or "clientserver" (async method on both client- and server-side):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<node name="/org/sdbuscpp/concatenator">
    <interface name="org.sdbuscpp.Concatenator">
        <method name="concatenate">
            <annotation name="org.freedesktop.DBus.Method.Async" value="client" />
            <arg type="ai" name="numbers" direction="in" />
            <arg type="s" name="separator" direction="in" />
            <arg type="s" name="concatenatedString" direction="out" />
        </method>
        <signal name="concatenated">
            <arg type="s" name="concatenatedString" />
        </signal>
    </interface>
</node>
```

For each client-side async method, a corresponding `on<MethodName>Reply` pure virtual function, where <MethodName> is capitalized D-Bus method name, is generated in the generated proxy class. This function is the callback invoked when the D-Bus method reply arrives, and must be provided a body by overriding it in the implementation class.
    
So in the specific example above, the stub generator will generate a `Concatenator_proxy` class similar to one shown in a [dedicated section above](#concatenator-client-glueh), with the difference that it will also generate an additional `virtual void onConcatenateReply(const sdbus::Error* error, const std::string& concatenatedString);` method, which we shall override in derived `ConcatenatorProxy`.

Using D-Bus properties
----------------------

Defining and working with D-Bus properties using XML description is quite easy.

### Defining a property in the XML

A property element has no arg child element. It just has the attributes name, type and access, which are all mandatory. The access attribute allows the values ‘readwrite’, ‘read’, and ‘write’.

An example of a read-write property `status`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<node name="/org/sdbuscpp/propertyprovider">
    <interface name="org.sdbuscpp.PropertyProvider">
        <!--...-->
        <property name="status" type="u" access="readwrite"/>
        <!--...-->
    </interface>
</node>
```

### Generated stubs

This is how generated adaptor and proxy classes would look like with the read-write `status` property. The adaptor:

```cpp
class PropertyProvider_adaptor
{
    /*...*/

public:
    PropertyProvider_adaptor(sdbus::IObject& object)
        : object_(object)
    {
        object_.registerProperty("status").onInterface(INTERFACE_NAME).withGetter([this](){ return this->status(); }).withSetter([this](const uint32_t& value){ this->status(value); });
    }

private:
    // property getter
    virtual uint32_t status() = 0;
    // property setter
    virtual void status(const uint32_t& value) = 0;
    
    /*...*/
};
#endif
```

The proxy:

```cpp
class PropertyProvider_proxy
{
    /*...*/
    
public:
    // getting the property value
    uint32_t status()
    {
        return object_.getProperty("status").onInterface(INTERFACE_NAME);
    }

    // setting the property value
    void status(const uint32_t& value)
    {
        object_.setProperty("status").onInterface(INTERFACE_NAME).toValue(value);
    }
    
    /*...*/
};
```

When implementing the adaptor, we simply need to provide the body for `status` getter and setter method by overriding them. Then in the proxy, we just call them.

Conclusion
----------

There is no conclusion. Happy journeys by D-Bus with sdbus-c++!
